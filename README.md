=========

HDX's Data Team (http://hdx.rwlabs.org) manages the data available in HDX's system. We use this GitHub repository to manage the issues that we are currently working on. 


What tasks are we working on now?
---------------------------------

At the top of our page you can see the issues we are considering now. We are using `waffle.io` to manage the current work-flow, which is updated each week. The tasks under `ready` mean those that are being considered for the following week. Click on this button to see the current tasks in the pipeline: [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/ocha-dap/data-team.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](https://waffle.io/ocha-dap/data-team)

All tasks in the issue page are being categorized into five categories: `Research`, `Analysis`, `HDX Repository`, and `HDX Curation Process System`. Besides the categories we also use three levels of priority to identify the tasks that need a lot of attention: `Low`, `Medium`, and `High`.
